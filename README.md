🎯 **Results-driven Backend & Full Stack Developer** with strong hands-on experience in **Core PHP, MySQL, AJAX**, along with **Python frameworks (Django, FastAPI)**.  
I specialize in building **real-world, scalable web applications** with clean backend logic, secure data handling, and interview-ready implementations.

I work across the full stack using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, Python** ensuring smooth client–server communication using HTTP & REST APIs.
